Externalize Configuration
1. how to host configure the host
2. how to host configure the github

Why we need separate configuration server.
* need to separate configuration from our codebase. it's not good use configurations with our codebase.
* may have 100 services in our application. has to make  sure each service has same configuration.
* should be able to change configurations while services are running.

we cannot create multiple servers for each server. But we can create one docker per a service.
