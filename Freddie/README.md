First, user has to enter the distance that how long Freddie . Then, it checks the distance is 0 or not. While the distance is 0, the loop is going. Then it checks whether the entered distance is more than or equal to 5, 3 and 1 respectively. (Since first jump takes 5 meters, second jump takes 3 meters, and third jump takes 1 meters). Then it increases the hop count by 1 and then add the rest time accordingly.

For some distance, this kind of output should be printed.

•	Distance 9 m : Hops – 3, rest time – 6.5 sec

•	Distance 18 m : Hops – 6, rest time – 13 sec

•	Distance 50 m : Hopes – 16, rest time – 33.5 sec

So, what happened to the distance like 7 meters. First jump, it covers 5 meters. At the end of the second jump, it covers 8 meters. So, assuming, the hop doesn’t take any time, when the distance is 7 meters, Freddie already took the next jump. So, Freddie takes 2 jumps when gives the distance as 7. But the rest time is different. When complete the 7 meters. The Freddie took only the rest time after the first jump.

For some distance like the above-mentioned situations, this kind of output should be printed.

•	Distance 7 m : Hops – 3, rest time – 1 sec

•	Distance 49 m : Hopes – 16, rest time – 32.5 sec

•	Distance 70 m : Hopes – 23, rest time – 46.5 sec

•	Distance 70 m : Hopes – 23, rest time – 46.5 sec
